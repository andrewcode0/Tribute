            <li><p><span class="bold">1950</span> - By the turn of the decade, Evans had met a waitress named <span class="bold">Ellaine Schultz</span>, who would become his partner for <span class="bold">twelve years</span>.</p></li>
            <li><p><span class="bold">1951-1954</span> - Bill's stay in the army, traumatizing him, he had nightmares for years.<p></li>
            <li><p><span class="bold">1953</span> - Evans composed his best-known tune, <span class="bold">"Waltz for Debby"</span>, for his young niece.During this period, he began using recreational drugs, occasionally smoking marijuana.</p></li>
            <li><p><span class="bold">1955</span> - Evans returned to <span class="bold">New York City</span> and enrolled in the <span class="bold">Mannes College of Music</span> for a three-semester postgraduate course in music composition. He also wrote classical settings of poems by <span class="bold">William Blake</span>.</p></li>
            <li><p><span class="bold">1956</span> - Producer Orrin Keepnews was convinced to record the reluctant Evans by a demo tape Mundell Lowe played to him over the phone. The result was his debut album, New Jazz Conceptions, featuring the original versions of <span class="bold">"Waltz for Debby"</span> and <span class="bold">"Five"</span>.The album began Evans's relationship with Riverside Records. Although a critical success that gained positive reviews in DownBeat and Metronome magazines, New Jazz Conceptions was initially a financial failure, <span class="bold">selling only 800 copies the first year</span>. "Five" was for some time <span class="bold">Evans's trio farewell tune</span> during performances.After the album's release, Evans spent much time <span class="bold">studying J. S. Bach's music to improve his technique</span>.</p></li>
            <li><p><span class="bold">1958</span> - At <span class="bold">Miles Davis's</span> urging, Russell drove Evans over to the Colony Club in Brooklyn, to play with <span class="bold">Davis' sextet</span>. At this time, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones were the other members of Davis' group. Red Garland had recently been fired and Evans knew it was an audition for the group's pianist. By the end of the night, Davis told Evans that <span class="bold">he would be playing their next engagement in Philadelphia</span>.While the band used to play a mixture of jazz standards and bebop originals, by that time Davis had begun his venture in modal jazz, having just released his album <span class="bold">Milestones</span>.
  <li><p><span class="bold">1961</span> - Evans recorded <span class="bold">Explorations</span> in February 1961, the trio's(Trio with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian) second official release.</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="bold">1962</span> - When he re-formed his trio, two albums, <span class="bold">Moon Beams</span> and <span class="bold">How My Heart Sings!</span> resulted.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="bold">1963</span> - Evans's heroin addiction increased following LaFaro's death. His girlfriend Ellaine was also an addict. Evans habitually had to borrow money from friends, and eventually, his electricity and telephone services were shut down. Evans said: "You don't understand. It's like death and transfiguration. Every day you wake in pain like death and then you go out and score, and that is transfiguration. Each day becomes all of life in microcosm."</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="bold">1966</span> - Evans discovered the young Puerto Rican bassist <span class="bold">Eddie Gómez</span>. In what turned out to be an eleven-year stay, Gómez sparked new developments in Evans's trio conception.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="bold">1968</span> - Drummer <span class ="bold">Marty Morell</span> joined the trio and remained until 1975, when he retired to family life. This was Evans's most stable, longest-lasting group.

One of these was "Comrade Conrad", a tune that had originated as a Crest toothpaste jingle and had later been reelaborated and dedicated to Conrad Mendenhall, a friend who had died in a car accident.</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="bold">1973</span> - While working in Redondo Beach, California, Evans met and fell in love with <span class="bold">Nenette Zazzara</span>, despite his long-term relationship with Ellaine.When Evans broke the news to Ellaine, she pretended to understand, but then committed suicide by throwing herself under a subway train. Evans's relatives believe that Ellaine's infertility, coupled with Bill's desire to have a son, may have influenced those events.As a result, Evans went back on heroin for a while before resuming methadone treatment.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="bold">1977</span> - Both <span class="bold">Will Say Goodbye</span> (Evans's last album for Fantasy Records) and <span class="bold">You Must Believe in Spring</span> (for Warner Bros.) highlighted changes that would become significant in the last stage of Evans's life. A greater emphasis was placed on group <span class="bold">improvisation and interaction, and new harmonic experiments were attempted</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="bold">1978</span> - Gómez and Zigmund left Evans. Evans then asked Philly Joe Jones, the drummer he considered his "all-time favorite drummer", to fill in. Several bassists were tried, with Michael Moore staying the longest. Evans finally settled on Marc Johnson on bass and Joe LaBarbera on drums. This trio would be <span class="bold">Evans's last</span>.</p></li>
  <li><p><span class="bold">1979</span> - Evans met <span class="bold">Laurie Verchomin</span>, a Canadian waitress (later, a writer) with whom he had a relationship until his death. Verchomin was 28 years younger.</p></li>

  <p class="miles"><i>"Bill had this quiet fire that I loved on piano. The way he approached it, the sound he got was like crystal notes or sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall. I had to change the way the band sounded again for Bill's style by playing different tunes, softer ones at first."</i>  -<span class="bold">Miles Davis</span></p>
